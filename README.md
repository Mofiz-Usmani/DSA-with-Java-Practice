📘 DSA-with-Java-Practice

This repository contains my practice code and notes for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java.
It includes step-by-step implementations, recursion problems, sorting, searching, and other core concepts in Java.

🚀 Contents

Basics of Java (syntax, boilerplate, input/output, operators)

Recursion (factorial, Fibonacci, sum of n, sorted array check, etc.)

Arrays (traversal, searching, sorting)

Strings (palindrome, reversal, manipulation)

Sorting Algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort)

Searching Algorithms (linear search, binary search)

OOP Concepts in Java (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)

Other DSA Topics coming soon...
